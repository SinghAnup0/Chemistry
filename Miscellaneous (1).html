homologous series for alkanols becomes CnH2+1OH.</div>
<div id="wrong52" class="wrong">Incorrect. In organic chemistry, a homologous series is 
a series of compounds with the same functional group 
and similar chemical properties and consecutive 
compounds differ by –CH2 unit. 
Hence, CH3OH and C2H5OH represent correct pair of 
homologous series.  
The functional group of alcohols is OH, thus the 
homologous series for alkanols becomes CnH2+1OH.</div>

down 
anaerobically into alcohal. In fermentation, say by yeast, 
the incomplete oxidation of glucose is achieved under 
anaerobic conditions by sets of reactions where pyruvic 
acid is converted to CO2 and Ethanol. The enzymes, 
pyruvic acid decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase 
catalyse these reactions. Other organisms like some 
bacteria produce lactic acid from pyruvic acid.</div>
