<div id="answer109" class="answer">Correct! Plaster of Paris is manufactured by heating 
gypsum at 120º and 150°K. On heating gypsum at 
150°C it loses water molecules and becomes calcium 
sulfate hemihydrate. This product is known as the 
plaster of Paris.  Hence option (c) is correct.  
The chemical formula for the plaster of Paris is 
(CaSO4) 1
2  H2O and is better known as calcium sulfate 
hemihydrate. Characteristics of Gypsum Plaster:– 
Plaster of Paris is usually a white dry plaster powder.  It 
can be effectively worked with metal apparatuses or
